### Xero Application

I decided to rewrite this in node.js since I basically write everything in node.js.

Language: TypeScript
Server Framework: Koa
CI/CD: 

    "": "^4.2.0",
    "": "^3.2.1",

## How To Run

- `npm install`
- `npm run start:dev`

## Improvements

- Added validation.
-

## Found Errors

- SSL port number `44335` seemingly wrong.
-


## Decisions

- I would have used GraphQL but it was clear that this was a rest API.
